## Principles matter

When I was (much) younger, I did a lot of martial arts (Wing Chun). While most
martial arts have a belt system where the black belt is the highest, with this
particular branch the highest level was actually the gold band. You'd start off
with white, then through a various spectrum of colors you'd end up after years
of hard training with the black belt. 

But after that, you'd go to gray and then green and then gold. Being the
annoying wanting-to-know-it-all I can still be sometimes, I asked: Why is that? 

When you start learning Wing Chun, you start as an empty slate (white). During
your training, you learn many new techniques and spend many (painful) hours
perfecting them. When you finally achieve the black belt, you should know all
techniques. But that's not when the journey ends. 

| To become a master you must learn the principles behind the techniques. Once
you understand the principles behind the techniques, you'll find that the actual
techniques are no longer important. 

In software engineering, I find we often focus too much on styles, tools and
techniques and not nearly enough time with the principles which would drive
which would drive your development choices. 

# Principles

So, here are the principles i'm trying to follow. 


## 1. Efficiency matters

We're a small team with limited amount of time and resources (while that's
likely true for almost all teams, it's especially true for startups). That means
we have to be smart about what we do and how we do things. If something is holding
us back or slowing us down in any way, we should look at solving that. 

### Focus on developer productivity

I  mentioned before

### Automate everything
Everything (within reason) should be automated. Anything that is done manually
can and will be forgotten. 

### Automated Testing

Automated testing is a key enabler for developer efficiency. the 

### Insights into everything
Interestingly, this means spending time early on on figuring out how to deploy,
run, analyze and operate the system. As soon as we write the first lines of
code, we'll introduce bugs. Efficient finding the root cause is going to be key. 

When it comes to coding, efficiency will also be key. 


## 3. Separate which is hard from which is simple. 

You want to spend your energy on things that really matter. 

## 4. Find the pit of success and plenty of safety nets
