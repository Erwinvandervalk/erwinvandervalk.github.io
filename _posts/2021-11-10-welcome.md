Welcome to my new and revamped blog. 

Many years ago, I used to occasionally blog. About things that I thought would be valuable for me to remember and perhaps would be valuable for other people as well. 

Now I never liked the blogging platform I used to use (blogger.com) and that was a big barrier for me to keep doing it. Now, i've moved to a github pages based blog. Let's see, hopefully i'll be able to keep it up and write about things that might interest you as well.
