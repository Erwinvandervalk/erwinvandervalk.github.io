# Joining a new startup Smart Cloud

Last week, I agreed to join a new startup Smart Cloud (working title). What the startup is about and what we're going to build I will hopefully be able to talk more about in the future. 

But for now, I thought it would be interesting to document our journey through technology from the absolute beginning to (hopefully) a thriving billion dollar success (or an abysmal failure and deep shame but more likely, something in the middle). 

So, in the near future, I hope to be able to write about:

* Which principles do we follow?
* What technologies do we pick and why?
* Which practices do we use and why?
* What type of architecture do we aim for and how does it evolve?
* What do we value (both technically and culturally)?

And as the system evolves:
* What works and what doesn't?
* What did we change? 
* What can't we change anymore but wish we could?

Anyway, I'm super excited to get started on this journey.
